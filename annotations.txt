- Rails:
  - Models are resources in the app like:
    - User
    - Post
    - Article
    - Stock
  - Views are the front-end of the app:
    - home view: home.html.erb
    - new post view: new.html.erb
    - friends view: friends.html.erb
    - my_portfolio view: my_porfolio.html.erb
  - Controller are the brains behind the application:
    - users_controller
    - post_controller
    - articles_controller
    - stock_controller
